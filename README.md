# R Binder Example

This repository takes a Jupyter Notebook as input and plots a heatmap after you mapped reads in your samples against bins or genomes you created. 

 - Launch in Jupyter: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/megaptera-helvetiae/MetaG-heat-Binder/fixr?filepath=MetaG-Heatmap.ipynb)

Example files included:

 - `MetaG-Heatmap.ipynb` - iPython notebook (R kernel) with R code chunks to plot a heatmap in RStudio
 - `input_matrix_v2.txt` - A sample input file where we mapped reads from several samples against MAG bins that we had created.
