# R + Python Binder Example

This repo builds on the [r binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/r) and [jupyter lab binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyterlab) and is complementary to the [multi-language-demo binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/multi-language-demo) with examples on using both R and python in both Jupyter Lab and RStudio.

 - Launch in RStudio: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/megaptera-helvetiae/MetaG-heat-Binder/master?urlpath=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmegaptera-helvetiae%2FMetaG-heat-Binder%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FMetaG-heatmap-Binder.Rmd)

Example files included:

 - `MetaG-heatmap-Binder.Rmd` - RMarkdown file with R code chunks to plot a heatmap in RStudio
 - `input_matrix_v1.txt` - A sample input file where we mapped reads from several samples against MAG bins that we had created.
