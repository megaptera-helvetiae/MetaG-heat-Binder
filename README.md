# R + Python Binder Example

This repo builds on the [r binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/r) and [jupyter lab binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyterlab) and is complementary to the [multi-language-demo binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/multi-language-demo) with examples on using both R and python in both Jupyter Lab and RStudio.

 - Launch in Jupyter Lab: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/r_with_python/master?urlpath=lab)
 - Launch in RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/r_with_python/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Example files included:

 - `MetaG-heatmap-Binder.Rmd` - RMarkdown file with R code chunks to plot a heatmap in RStudio
 - `input_matrix_v1.txt` - A sample input file where we mapped reads from several samples against MAG bins that we had created.
